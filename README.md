# Welcome to SISH
SISH: Super Insecure Shell, a SSH-like program for the Minecraft ComputerCraft mod
This is a fork of ISH
Designed to be used on Startup for a cyberpunk roleplay server some friends and I are working on

# NOTICE
Make sure to set up the details before launching the code, it's designed so you dont have to do setup every time you run the program but if you dont set the Hostname you may be confused as to how to connect.
